# PHY 2049 LaTeX Notes
This repo consists of my digitized LaTeX notes for University of Florida's `PHY 2049` course in the semester of Spring 2023.

## For Users
Download the latest zip file (not source code) from releases. This will most likely be updated every chapter, but earlier is possible.

### Note!
Sometimes, my notes make references to "See page X". The book this is referring to is specifically *Fundamentals of Physics Extended, Vol. 10*. This is most likely not the version you're using in class. Its ISBN number is `1118230728` if you want to seek it out yourself ;).

## For Contributors
Think I explained something not well? You're probably right. You know how to work the circuit package and can provide good diagrams for those chapters? Be my guest! If you know LaTeX and want to contribute, clone this repo and develop to your hearts content, then make a pull request!

Don't know LaTeX? That's fine! If you think something is missing or can be worded better, submit an Issue!
